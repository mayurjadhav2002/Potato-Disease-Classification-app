# Potato Disease Classification Using CNN and Tensorflow
Every year, the agriculture sector faces, crops related issues. Altough there agriculture
many chemicals available to prevent this, but, in most cases, farmers could not able realise the early symptoms of plant. To overcome this, I created a Potato Disease Classifier app which will help farmers to detect the symtoms.

CNN is used to classifies the images. With Epoch of 50 the model can give > 99% accuracy. Six Convolution 2 dimentional Layers used and data divided into 80:20 ratio. ie. 80% Training 20% Testing
